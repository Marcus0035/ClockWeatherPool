ClockWeatherPool is a lightweight app made for a tablet with a broken touchscreen. Since the device couldn’t be used normally, the app turns it into an always-on display that shows useful info without any interaction.
What It Shows:

-Big, clear clock – Always visible, easy to read.
-Weather updates – Current temperature and conditions.
-Pool occupancy – Live count of how many people are at the local swimming pool.

P.S.: I’m aware there’s an API key somewhere in the source code, but I’m not entirely sure where to put it. So, feel free to enjoy those 1 million calls while I figure it out!

ClockWeatherPool is a lightweight app made for a tablet with a broken touchscreen. Since the device couldn’t be used normally, the app turns it into an always-on display that shows useful info without any interaction.
What It Shows:

    Big, clear clock – Always visible, easy to read.
    Weather updates – Current temperature and conditions.
    Pool occupancy – Live count of how many people are at the local swimming pool.
